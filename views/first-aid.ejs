                        Immediate first aid response can mean the difference between life and death in emergencies.
                        This guide covers critical interventions for common emergencies, equipping you with knowledge
                        to act confidently until professional help arrives. Remember: Always prioritize personal
                        safety and call emergency services first.

                    <h2>CPR Basics</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) maintains blood flow when someone's heart stops.
                        For adults: Position hands on breastbone, push hard and fast (100-120 compressions/minute).
                        For infants: Use two fingers with gentle compressions. Combine with rescue breaths if trained.
                        Continue until help arrives or the person revives.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Burn Treatment</h2>
                    <p>
                        For thermal burns: Cool with running water for 10-20 minutes. Never apply ice.
                        Cover with sterile non-stick dressing. For chemical burns: Flush with water for 20+ minutes.
                        Remove contaminated clothing carefully. Seek medical help for severe burns or facial injuries.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Choking Response</h2>
                    <p>
                        For conscious adults: Perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) until obstruction clears.
                        For infants: Alternate back blows and chest thrusts. If person becomes unconscious, begin CPR.
                        Never perform blind finger sweeps which might push obstruction deeper.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Bleeding Control</h2>
                    <p>
                        Apply direct pressure with clean cloth. Elevate injured area above heart level if possible.
                        Use pressure points for severe bleeding. Tourniquets are last resort for limb injuries -
                        note application time. Watch for shock signs: pale skin, rapid pulse, confusion.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Fracture Management</h2>
                    <p>
                        Immobilize injured area using splints or rigid materials. Support joints above and below injury.
                        For open fractures: Cover wound with sterile dressing without pushing on protruding bone.
                        Apply cold packs to reduce swelling. Seek immediate medical attention for proper alignment.
