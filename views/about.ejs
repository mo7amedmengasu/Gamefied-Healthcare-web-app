            <h2>🎮 What is HealthQuest?</h2>
            <p>
                HealthQuest is an interactive learning platform designed to educate users about health topics through
                games, quizzes, and challenges. Whether you're a student, parent, or health enthusiast, HealthQuest
                helps you build healthy habits while having fun.

            <h2>🧠 Why Gamified Learning?</h2>
            <p>
                Traditional health education can feel boring or overwhelming. By combining game mechanics with learning,
                we boost motivation, improve retention, and make health education something to look forward to.
